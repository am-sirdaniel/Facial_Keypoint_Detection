# Facial_Keypoint_Detection
This was my 1st project as part of the Udacity Computer Vision Nanodegree Program. 

I defined the network architecture using the original Facial Keypoint Paper. Check paper here https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.00977.pdf . The model was trained using Google Colab's compute resources. The designed was built using the design from the original paper.
